sentence=MQTT library for Arduino based on the Eclipse Paho projects (modified to resolve library naming conflicts, and added various enhancements)
paragraph=This library bundles the Embedded MQTT C/C++ Client library of the Eclipse Paho project and adds a thin wrapper to get an Arduino like API. Additionally there is an drop-in alternative for the Arduino YÃ¹n that uses a python based client on the linux processor and a binary interface to lower program space usage on the Arduino side (modified to resolve library naming conflicts, as well as to add various enhancements).
